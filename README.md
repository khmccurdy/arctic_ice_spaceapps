# NASA SpaceApps Challenge 2018
### "Polar Opposites" prompt
Kevin McCurdy, Mike Chou, Kelvin Lo

## Objective
"(to) analyze and visualize NASA’s Arctic and/or Antarctic ice sheets and sea ice data to tell their story 
over time and over the three spatial dimensions."

### Applications
* Climate change analytics & forecasting
* Arctic shipping route predictions


## Challenges
### Climate Change Analytics & forecasting
* Lots of raw satellite data to sift through
* Different satellites/operations provide different data types (temp, ice thickness, snow density, laser scanned topography, etc.) 
* Various file formats (.nc, .txt, .h5, etc.) over roughly the same area (but not exact bounding rectangle) 
* Data is only past history; what’s probably going to happen to local iceforms?
### Arctic Shipping route predictions
* Satellite data not always available (data downlink/revisit rate)
* Ice can form very quickly
* Ships don’t want to sink but it’s a faster route vs Panama Canal/going around South America
